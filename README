This is a conversion table between dBV, dBu, Volts RMS, and Volts peak-to-peak
(the last assuming a sinewave). I couldn't find a good precise table that also
had all the values which one could need, so I created this with bc, the
arbitrary-precision calculator, and I used arbitrary-precision numbers in
Python to process the formatting. I hope this is useful for you. You can
execute ./run to re-create the table on your computer, especially if you want a
different amount of precision or different values. You can also just read the
file ``table´´ for an example of output.
